# NYC-Taxi
Exploratory Data Analysis of the "2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data" dataset and modeling for trip duration prediction.

A data science project for STAT 457 - Statistical Learning.

Dataset: [NYC Taxi and Limousine Commision](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)

The repository includes the following:

- `load_preprocess_data.py`: loads data and creates custom features including distance-based features, time-based features, and location-based features.
- `EDA.ipynb`: exploratory data analysis of dataset including custom features (the `figs` directory includes figures generated by this notebook).
- `modeling.ipynb`: modeling experiments for predicting trip duration.
- `modeling_tabnet.ipynb`: experimenting with the TabNet neural network architecture for tabular learning.

The [pdf report](https://github.com/Awni00/NYC-Taxi/blob/main/NYC%20Taxi%20Trip%20Modeling%20Report.pdf) describes the methodology and the results.
